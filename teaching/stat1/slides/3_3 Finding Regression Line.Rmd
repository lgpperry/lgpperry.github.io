## Goals

1.  Calculate and interpret a regression line.
2.  Interpret a coefficient of determination. 
3.  Understand the relationship between a correlation coefficient and a coefficient of determination.
4.  Use a regression line to make predictions.
    - Identify potential problems with predictions.

## Residuals

**Residuals** are the leftover *stuff* (variation) in the data after
accounting for model fit:
$$\text{data} = \text{prediction} + \text{residual}$$ 

## Residuals

- Each observation has its own residual. 
- The residual for an observation $(x,y)$ is the
difference between observed ($y$) and predicted ($\hat{y}$):
$$e = y - \hat{y}$$ 
- We denote the residuals by $e$ and find $\hat{y}$ by
plugging $x$ into the regression equation. 

Note: If an observation lands above
the regression line, $e > 0$. If below, $e < 0$.

## Residuals

Goal: get each residual as close to 0 as possible. 

To shrink the residuals toward 0, we minimize:
\[
\begin{align}
\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2 &= \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^n [y_i - (b_0 + b_1 x_i)]^2
\end{align} 
\]

The values $b_0$ and $b_1$ that minimize this will make up our regression line.

## Finding $b_0$ and $b_1$

- The slope is
$$b_1 = \frac{s_y}{s_x}\times R$$ 
- The intercept is
$$b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x}$$

## Example: Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone

- `eruptions`, the length of each eruption
- `waiting`, the time between eruptions

```{r}
plot(faithful$waiting, faithful$eruptions, xlab="Waiting Time", ylab="Eruption Duration")
```

## Example: Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone

The sample statistics for these data are

 |      |    `waiting`    |  `eruptions`   |
 |:----:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
 | mean | $\bar{x}=70.90$ | $\bar{y}=3.49$ |
 |  sd  |   $s_x=13.60$   |   $s_y=1.14$   |
 |      |                 |   $R = 0.90$   |
 
 Find the regression line and interpret the parameters.
 
## Example: Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone

 |      |    `waiting`    |  `eruptions`   |
 |:----:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
 | mean | $\bar{x}=70.90$ | $\bar{y}=3.49$ |
 |  sd  |   $s_x=13.60$   |   $s_y=1.14$   |
 |      |                 |   $R = 0.90$   |

The equation for slope is
$$b_1 = \frac{s_y}{s_x}\times R$$ 
so
$$b_1 = \frac{1.14}{13.60}\times 0.90 = 0.075$$

## Example: Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone

 |      |    `waiting`    |  `eruptions`   |
 |:----:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
 | mean | $\bar{x}=70.90$ | $\bar{y}=3.49$ |
 |  sd  |   $s_x=13.60$   |   $s_y=1.14$   |
 |      |                 |   $R = 0.90$   |

The equation for the intercept is
$$b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x}$$ and we found $b_1 = 0.093$ so
$$b_0 = 3.49 - 0.075\times 70.90 = -1.83$$
 
***

Putting these together, the regression line is $$\hat{y} = -1.83 + 0.075x$$

```{r, message=F}
plot(x = faithful$waiting, y = faithful$eruptions,
     xlab = "Waiting Time (minutes)",
     ylab = "Eruption Duration (minutes)")
abline(summary(lm(formula = eruptions ~ waiting, data=faithful))$coef[,1],
       col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

## The Coefficient of Determination

The **coefficient of determination**, $R^2$, is the square of the correlation coefficient.

- This value tells us how much of the variability around the regression line is accounted for by the regression. 
- An easy way to interpret this value is to assign it a letter grade. 
    - For example, if $R^2 = 0.84$, the predictive capabilities of the regression line get a B.
    
## Example: Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone

 |      |    `waiting`    |  `eruptions`   |
 |:----:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
 | mean | $\bar{x}=70.90$ | $\bar{y}=3.49$ |
 |  sd  |   $s_x=13.60$   |   $s_y=1.14$   |
 |      |                 |   $R = 0.90$   |
 
Since $R = 0.90$, we can find $R^2 = 0.90^2 = 0.81$ 

That is, 81\% of the variability around the regression line is accounted for by the regression and this line gets a B

## Prediction: Some Notes

It's important to stop and think about our predictions.

- Sometimes, the numbers just don't make sense.
- Other times it's harder to tell something's wrong!

## Extrapolation

*Extrapolation* is applying a model estimate for values outside of the data's range for $x$. 

- Our linear model is only an approximation.
    - We don't know anything about the relationship outside of the scope of our data.

## Example

```{r}
set.seed(1)

x.dat <- runif(100,5,20)
y.dat <- 2*log(x.dat) + rnorm(100,0,0.4)
mod <- lm(y.dat ~ x.dat)

plot(x.dat,y.dat, pch=16, xlim=c(5,20), ylab="y", xlab="x"); abline(mod$coefficients[1], mod$coefficients[2], col='red', lwd=3); 
```

## Example

The best fit line is $$\hat{y} = 2.69 + 0.179x$$ 

- The correlation is $R=0.877$.
- So the coefficient of determination is $R^2 = 0.767$.
    - (think: a C grade)

## Prediction: Some Notes

Suppose we wanted to predict the value of $y$ when $x=0.1$: $$\hat{y} = 2.66 + 0.181\times0.1 = 2.67$$

## Prediction: Some Notes

This seems reasonable... but the true (population) best-fit model looks like this:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x <- seq(from=0.1, to=25, by=0.1)
y <- 2*log(x)

x.dat <- runif(100,5,20)
y.dat <- 2*log(x.dat) + rnorm(100,0,0.5)
mod <- lm(y.dat ~ x.dat)

plot(x,y,type='l', lwd=3, col='red', ylim=c(min(y), max(y.dat))); points(x.dat,y.dat, pch=16); abline(v=5); abline(v=20); 
  points(x=0.1, y=mod$coefficients[1]+0.1* mod$coefficients[2], pch=16, col='blue'); abline(v=0.1, lty=2)
```
