## Goals 

1. Use a desired maximum margin of error to calculate a sample size.
2. Use a desired maximum interval width to calculate a sample size.

## Sample Size

Other than level of confidence, there is one other thing we can control in the confidence interval: the sample size $n$. 

- We can specify the confidence level and the maximum acceptable interval width and use these to determine sample size. 
- We know that $$\text{interval width} \ge 2z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$
- Letting interval width equal $w$, we can solve for $n$: $$ n \ge \left(2z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{w}\right)^2$$ 

## Sample Size

Alternately, we may specify a maximum margin of error $m$ instead: $$ n \ge \left(z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{m}\right)^2$$ 

- Once we've done a sample size calculation, we need a whole number for $n$. 
- Since $n \ge$ something, we will *always round up*.

## Checkpoint 

Suppose we want a 95\% confidence interval for the mean of a normally distributed population with standard deviation $\sigma=10$. It is important for our margin of error to be no more than 2. What sample size do we need?

## Some comments

- As desired width/margin of error decreases, $n$ will increase. 
- As $\sigma$ increases, $n$ will also increase. (More population variability will necessitate a larger sample size.)
- As confidence level increases, $n$ will also increase.

## Checkpoint

Prior experience with SAT scores in the CSU system suggests that SAT scores are well-approximated by a normal distribution with standard deviation known to be 50. 

Find the sample size required for a 98% confidence interval with maximum margin of error 10.
