## About

As a college student, I went to six different colleges and universities, switched majors countless times, and finally graduated after five years. I started college wanting to be an opera singer and starred in a condensed version of Leonard Bernstein's <a href="https://vimeo.com/32599888" target="_blank">Trouble in Tahiti</a>. Eventually I found my way to Statistics and went on to do my PhD in Applied Statistics at UC Riverside.

I ended up in statistics because I love solving puzzles and learning about everything (and talking to everyone). When I'm not working, I'm an enthusiastic <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/" target="_blank">TTRPG'er</a> and I enjoy playing music. My partner is also a teacher and we spend our breaks traveling. I also love animals and we have a <a href="https://lgpperry.github.io/Meet-the-Rescues/">little menagerie of rescues</a>.
