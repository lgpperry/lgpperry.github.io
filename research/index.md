My research is primarily in applied statistics, where I do a lot of collaborative work with other researchers. I am always open to mentoring student research and am happy to work on projects outside of the current scope of my research. 

## Consulting

I do consulting work as time permits. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions at perry@csus.edu. 

Sacramento State also offers a Capstone Course where our students take on consulting projects free of charge. [Click here](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=AZC0tj-L-kOZoXBujH41mM5QfwqOc9RKgZnet9bSVfpUNUVCTDBUQjE2SkVEVVg0WkhDUjU3UVlITy4u&route=shorturl) for the inquiry form. 

## Student research

If you are a student interested in statistics research, [send me an email](mailto:perry@csus.edu)! I would be happy to chat with you about your options.
