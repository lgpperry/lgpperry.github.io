## Fiddler

A couple of friends started feeding a stray cat that wandered into their yard in early 2017. A couple months later she had four kittens in their upstairs closet. I took this perfect floofy angel off their hands. Fiddler is super friendly but won't hesitate to knock your glassware off the counter.

## Suki

I rescued Suki after moving to Sacramento in summer 2020. I found her on Craigslist. The guy who got rid of her had a newborn and was keeping her outside all the time because he didn't know how to manage such a high energy dog. She's an Austrailian cattle dog mix - a smart, eager-to-please, high-energy breed! She loves to learn and I do a lot of little tricks with her.

## Sokka

I got Sokka from Sacramento Independent Animal Rescuers in January 2021. He's very wary of new people, but if he likes you he loves to snuggle.
